Spring Boot is a great way to write an application in Java. This workshop shows you how to create a Spring Boot application and run it in Kubernetes with as little fuss and bother as possible. The topics we will cover are:

1. Create a Spring Boot application
2. Containerize it, and push the container to a registry
3. Deploy it to Kubernetes

We don't cover all the features of Spring and Spring Boot. For more information you can check out the [Spring guides](https://spring.io/guides) or [Spring project homepages](https://spring.io/projects).

We also don't cover all the options available for building container images. There is a [Spring Boot topical guide](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/) covering some of those options in more detail.

When it comes to deploying the application to Kubernetes, there are far too many options to cover them all in one tutorial. We can look at one or two, but the emphasis will be on getting something working as quickly as possible, not on how to deploy to a production cluster.
